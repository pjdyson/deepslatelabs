Interesting story about how claude has been used to create and manage a 'financially motivated' and political social media campaign

Two things that I found interesting:
1. This was done by 'weaponising' a public-facing service, which indicates that the risk of being found through anthropic's logs outweighed the cost of setting up and delivering the AI service privately. This risk seems to have outweighed the cost of managing their own compute resources to deliver the AI, and/or the expertise needed to setup and manage it.

2. The campaign required several layers of complexity, from being able to draft posts, comments and DMs, to strategicly scanning other social media accounts to make decisions on what to comment on and post. 

I would expect this required a lot of training/testing/trial before the 'real' campain was established. So this group may well be operating thousands of fake accounts using this method across development, testing and active campaigns. So be aware of who you are talking to, and social media platforms should also take note.

Although, having very strategicly-engaging scam-bots on social media platforms may well be driving engagement . . . . so let's think about if we can rely on social media companies to help in the solution!
