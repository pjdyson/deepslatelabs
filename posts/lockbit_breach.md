# Lockbit Breach

It's not often that you see a data breach as a positive, but hear me out . . A few weeks ago the LockBit ransomware gang was breached in a significant incident that exposed sensitive internal data and dealt a major blow to its operations and reputation.

## Key Details of the Breach:

The breach was discovered on May 7, 2025, when a threat actor known as "Rey" identified that LockBit's affiliate panels had been defaced and replaced with a link to a leaked SQL database. The defaced message read: "𝐃𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞, 𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐌𝐄 𝐈𝐒 𝐁𝐀𝐃 𝐱𝐨𝐱𝐨 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐮𝐞,"and provided a downloadable archive of the stolen data.
LockBit’s operator, LockBitSupp, confirmed the breach but claimed that ransomware source code and decryptors were not leaked

## What Was Exfiltrated? The leaked data was extensive and included:

• 𝐀𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐝𝐦𝐢𝐧 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:The database contained a list of 75 administrators and affiliates, including user credentials (with some plaintext passwords), and 76 user credentials identified by security researchers-22 of which included TOX messaging IDs used by hackers

• 𝐍𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐕𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐦 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:Over 4,400 messages from negotiations between LockBit and its victims were exposed, providing insight into ransom tactics, demands (ranging from a few thousand to over $100,000), and victim profiles, including estimated revenues

• 𝐁𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐖𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐬: Nearly 60,000 unique Bitcoin addresses linked to LockBit operations were leaked, which could help trace ransom payments and financial flows

• 𝐌𝐚𝐥𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: The database included details about custom ransomware builds, configurations for attacks (such as which systems to skip or encrypt), and insights into LockBit’s infrastructure and potential victims/targets. 

• 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐬:Internal conversations between affiliates and victims, as well as between group members, were exposed

Notably, there is no evidence that ransomware decryptors or source code were leaked, so the breach does not directly help current victims recover encrypted data
