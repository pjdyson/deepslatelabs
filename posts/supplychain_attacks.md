Supply chain attacks aren’t just increasing, they’re becoming the costliest cyber threat in history. In 2025 alone, these attacks are projected to cost businesses $60 billion globally, with 45% of organizations expected to experience at least one breach.
Here’s what’s driving this surge, and how you can protect your organization:

## 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭
The global cost of software supply chain attacks is skyrocketing: from $46B in 2023 to an estimated $60B in 2025, and 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 $138𝐁 𝐛𝐲 2031 (15% year-over-year growth, Cybersecurity Ventures). 
In the first five months of 2025, 79 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐲 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬 were documented, with 63% targeting IT, tech, and telecom companies, prime targets for threat actors(Cyble Research). 
Gartner predicts that by 2025, 45% 𝐨𝐟 𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝𝐰𝐢𝐝𝐞 will have experienced a supply chain attack, a three-fold increase since 2021.

## 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐀𝐫𝐞 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐬 𝐒𝐨 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞?
Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in software development, open-source artifacts, and third-party vendors. 
Recent incidents like the 𝐗𝐙 𝐔𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐬 𝐛𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐨𝐫 and 𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐧𝐩𝐦 𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 on GitHub show how threat actors infiltrate trusted software (Kaspersky). 
The 𝐌𝐎𝐕𝐄𝐢𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭 (2023) impacted thousands of organizations and cost over $12B, highlighting the devastating potential (Cybersecurity Ventures).

## 𝐖𝐡𝐨’𝐬 𝐚𝐭 𝐑𝐢𝐬𝐤?
IT and software companies are top targets, but no industry is immune. Public administration, education, and critical infrastructure are seeing sharp rises, with ransomware up 70% in educational institutions over the past year. Organizations with revenues over $50M are 2.5x more likely to face a cyber incident (Insurance Business).

## 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐃𝐨?
- Conduct thorough risk assessments of your supply chain, including third-party vendors.

- Monitor build pipelines and software dependencies for suspicious activity (SBOMs and automated scanning help).

- Invest in cyber resilience, less than half of businesses have assessed their supply chain risks.

- Collaborate with vendors to ensure security standards and shared threat intelligence.
