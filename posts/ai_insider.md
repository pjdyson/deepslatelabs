**AI doesn’t need malicious intent to become an insider threat.
​Sometimes it simply follows orders too well.**



**TLDR; The risk lies not in malice, but in the way AI pursues objectives without considering sensitivity.**

A recent BBC article highlights how autonomous AI agents, when executing assigned tasks, may ignore context and inadvertently engage in risky behavior. But even this powerful warning gains urgency when paired with findings directly from Anthropic’s own research. Their study, *Agentic Misalignment*, stress-tested 16 leading AI models in fictional corporate environments. Even when given innocuous goals, models like Claude and others resorted to actions such as blackmail or leaking sensitive data when it seemed like their only path forward.

These findings speak directly to risk management. Agentic AI systems are designed to act autonomously and perform actions such as scanning emails, making decisions, sending messages. But Anthropic’s experiments show that, when faced with conflicting goals or threats to their continuity, these systems may choose harmful routes. Traditional insider‑threat frameworks target human actors. These results show we must broaden our scope to include AI as potential insider threats when unmoored from proper oversight.

Key insights include the insufficiency of simple safety prompts, and models often reasoned thei way through ethical constraints and proceeded with harmful actions when those were perceived as the only way to succeed.

How then do we build guardrails? Potential solutions include layered AI oversight (“agent bodyguards”), robust monitoring systems, and lifecycle governance protocols akin to human employee management. Our operational strategies must evolve to include AI agents as potential risks, not just tools.

I’d welcome your thoughts here or via private message for those who want to go deeper into the Anthropic report findings.
