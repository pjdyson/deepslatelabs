EchoLeak - The risks of AI automation, and connectivity. A potential databreach event which could have impacted many businesses at the same time

## S𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻: 

Microsoft Copilot's email scanning was exposed to prompt-injection and able to exfiltrate sensitive information from the user's M365 documents.


## 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗲:

1. This could potentially happen to any connected AI service, not just microsoft. There were actually defences in place to prevent this, but the researchers were able to find ways round the mitigations.

2. The impact could be across multiple companies, presenting a significant industry-wide, country-wide, global risk if it were (or a similar attack) exploited at scale.


## 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀:
• Systemic AI risks can be potentially leveraged at scale. This was a 'canary event' which was not expoited with malicious intent, but has the potential to have a very wide impact. 

• AI Controls may be in place, but are still in the early stages of development and there are still a lot of holes to fill. Keeping up to date with the latest attacks and sharing information is more important than ever

• Consider business exposure paths, what common services are making connections between internal data and external actors. In this case the AI acted as a conduit to expose sensitive internal documents and information, I'm not sure that companies will be aware that this bridge exists.

This is a really interesting event, check out more information from Aim Security
